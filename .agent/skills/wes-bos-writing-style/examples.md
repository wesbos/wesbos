# Writing Style Examples

Real examples from wesbos.com blog posts demonstrating the voice and patterns.

## Opening Examples

### Pain Point Opener
> In JavaScript, when you want to put a variable inside of a string, it's a pain in the ass because you have to stop your string, concatenate on the variable, and then open your string again and keep going.

### Direct Question Opener
> How do you comment in JSX? Regular `{/* */}` comments? HTML comments? Something else? Comments in JSX are weird and when searching for information, it's hard to find a straightforward answer. So here it is:

### Personal Story Opener
> I needed to screenshot a single element from a webpage, but without the background.

### Excited Announcement Opener
> It's here! I'm incredibly proud to announce my latest course — Beginner JavaScript.

### "We Need to Talk" Opener
> We need to have a talk about phone numbers on our mobile sites.

## Addressing the Reader

### Voicing the Reader's Objections
> "But Wes, what should I build? I have no ideas! Please don't make me do another todo app."

### Rhetorical Question as Transition
> What is `width`? It's `undefined`. Why? Because when you have an arrow function, it does not change the value of `this`.

### Collaborative "We"
> Let's take a look at what problem JavaScript destructuring really solves. We know that we can grab properties off of an object...

## Humor Examples

### Casual Word Choice
> Before you start going absolutely bananas on using arrow functions everywhere, we need to chat.

### Self-Deprecating
> After shamefully crawling back to Coda, I decided to give Sublime Text 2 a try.

### Absurd Example Data
> The user didn't like that Snickers is a hundred years old.

### Exaggerated Objection
> WHAT ABOUT VPNS?!?! PEOPLE ARE GONNA CHEAT!! LOL DUMASS!

### Pop Culture Reference
> `${'woof' * 5}`.repeat(10) + " Batman!" -- filed under the heading "Very Important"

## Code Introduction Examples

### Conversational Setup
> Here I've got a `class`. We haven't learned about classes yet, but just know that this is a way for us to make new cars.

### Showing the Old Way First
> What we would normally do is we would add an if loop. It works fine there, but there's a whole lot of code that we added.

### Incremental Building
> Let's start with a simple function. Now, let's convert it to an arrow function. First, we remove the function keyword...

## Sign-off Examples

> That's it, That's all.

> Put that in your back pocket, because you'll need it someday!

> Enjoy!

> Hopefully that clears up a few questions!

> Hope it helps.

## Paragraph Rhythm Example

This is the typical rhythm -- short explanation, code, short explanation, code:

> Default function arguments in JavaScript are here. They are one of my favourite new features because they are so handy and I use them almost every day.
>
> [code block]
>
> What does that do? If I don't pass the tax amount, it's going to default to 0.13 because I live in Ontario, Canada and we pay 13% HST.
>
> [code block]
>
> That's really handy in many use cases.

## Title Examples

Good titles that are direct, descriptive, with a hook:

- "A Dead Simple intro to Destructuring JavaScript Objects"
- "Is var Dead? What should I use?"
- "When Not to use an Arrow Function"
- "CSS object-fit is background-size: cover; for video"
- "Quick Tip - Use let with for Loops in JavaScript"
- "What I learned interviewing with Google"
