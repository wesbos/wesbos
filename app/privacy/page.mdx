In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you become a registered User or begin to make a purchase from the Site, we require you to provide various contact and identity information and other information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site, and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. In addition, as you use the Site, you can from time to time enter or send to us personal information.

You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a User or by not using the particular feature of the Site for which the information is being collected.

## Our Disclosure of Your Information

We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit consent. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services:

Anonymized Aggregated Data. We aggregate and anonymize data and use and disclose such information for a variety of purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.

Public Areas of the Site. All of your activities in the public areas of the Site will be identifiable to your User ID, and other people can see your published content.

Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Service Providers. We may from time to time use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service providers in the operation of the Site, and may disclose your information to them in the course of our use of their services. For example, we may use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the operation of the Site. This may involve the hosting of data, including your information, on servers operated by those hosting companies. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable and able to live up to our and your expectations, including about the handling of confidential information.

Law and Harm; Jurisdictions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or any other person’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information. Finally, please note that in some cases, information that we collect may be stored or processed outside of Canada. In such cases, we continue to protect the information with appropriate safeguards, but it may be subject to the legal jurisdiction of those countries and governmental authorities in those countries. Please see the bottom of this policy for further information about how to direct any questions you might have about service providers outside of Canada.

Sale of Business. We may also disclose your information to the acquiror or its agents in the course of the sale of our business. If we do this, the disclosure will be subject to confidentiality arrangements customary in such transactions.

## Security

We strive to protect your personal information. For security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any personal information you enter into registration forms on the Site. The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. We also make commercially reasonable effort to ensure the security of your personal information on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

## Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

Our goal is to retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; this retention period may extend past the point at which you close your account.

The criteria that will be for determining periods of retention will be based on the type of data. For example, data relevant to accounting information will be retained for at least 7 years, whereas temporary cookie data of a Site visitor may not be retained at all.

## Other Information Collectors

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties through the Site (including our payment processors), different rules may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use, collection or disclosure policies of third parties, you are subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

## International Transfers of Personal Information

We store personal information about Users within Canada, the United States and in other countries and territories. To facilitate our operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which we have operations. Therefore, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), your personal information may be processed outside of the EEA and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide for the same level of data protection as the EEA.

In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior consent to such international data transfers.

We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your personal information is transferred to countries outside the EEA. For further details on the transfer of your personal information, including a list of the organizations with whom said information may be shared, please reach out to our team at the email address provided below.

## Residents of the EEA and the State of California

If you are a resident of the EEA or the State of California you may have additional rights relating to the privacy of your information. We comply with the privacy laws applicable to residents of the EEA and the State of California.
