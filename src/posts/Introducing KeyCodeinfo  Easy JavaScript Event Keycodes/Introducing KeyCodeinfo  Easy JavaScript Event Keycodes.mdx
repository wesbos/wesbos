In JavaScript or jQuery you often need to find out which key was pressed. Unfortunately, we don't have it as easy as comparing it against a string like "esc" or "space bar".
Each key on the keyboard is associated with a number, or what we call a keyCode and it is accessed on the event object.

When I do keycode listening, I always scrounge the net for the appropriate keycode to check for. No more! I've made <a href="http://keycode.info" title="JavaScript Event KeyCodes" target="_blank">keycode.info</a> which does one thing well: tells you the asociated keycode and key when you tap any key on your keyboard.

Simple and easy. Hope you find it useful. <a href="http://keycode.info" target="_blank">Head on over</a> or make it better on <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/keycodes" target="_blank">github</a>.
