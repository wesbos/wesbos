Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of everyone's /uses pages!

Everyday I get a few emails asking about the specifics of some piece of software or hardware I use.

I change up things fairly often, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

If there is something missing shoot me a tweet [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and I'll add it.

Most of these links are amazon affiliate links, so I'll get philthy rich if you click them and buy something.

### Editor + Terminal

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor which I switched to in September 2017 after years of Sublime Text.
* [Sublime Text](http://SublimeText.com/3dev) V3 beta is used in most of my video tutorials — I write more about my setup in [my book](http://SublimeTextBook.com).
* I created a theme called Cobalt2 for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2), [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2) and [iTerm2](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) v3 which I use.
* I'm currently using [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) for a font. Yes I paid the $200 for it. Yes I actually like it. Before that I used [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) for many years.
* Firefox Developer has been my main browser since January 2020. We did a [show on it here](https://syntax.fm/show/213/hasty-treat-a-month-on-firefox)
* The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work - my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.
* I currently use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) for my terminal, but many of my videos show me using iTerm2.
* For Sublime Text, The JavaScript suggestions you see in my videos is called [JavaScript Completions](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20Completions) - you might have to play with the settings to get it to not popup some of the node completions. For VS Code, there are no plugins needed to get this.
* You can see most of my config files (.eslint, VS Code settings) over at my [Dot Files repo](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles) but please don't just take these settings carte blanche - they work for me but might not be the best

### Desktop Apps

* I use [Better Touch Tool](https://folivora.ai/) for window management, custom keyboard shortcuts (via the Hyper key) and a few other things. Best mac software ever!
* I use [Text Expander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander) for canned responses and for most of my code snippets
* I'm a huge [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) fan and have many [workflows](http://wes.io/fY7q).
* I use [Things App](https://culturedcode.com/things/) with a [GTD mindset](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) for managing my tasks.
* I design almost entirely in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
* The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is [Rocket](http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)

### Backup Strategy

My Backup strategy is as follows:

* I backup my entire computer locally to a Time Machine on a [LaCie rugged](https://amzn.to/3ti4IMp) portable hard drive
* I backup my entire computer remotely to [BackBlaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/008x60)
* I still use [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) quite a bit, but it's a huge resource hog.
* I run a [Synology NAS DS920+](https://amzn.to/3cvGMzf) with 4 [4TB Seagate Ironwolf HDD](https://amzn.to/36S8lzh)

### Recording

* I use [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) to record and edit my screencasts
* My mic is a [Heil PR40](https://amzn.to/36AOpR2) with a [BSW RE27POP Pop Filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011SRQ24G/) on a [PL2T boom arm](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZVZ74/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SZVZ74&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=HJ6K3KRLOL5XJJSC). Many of my earlier videos were recorded on the cheaper but still amazing [AT2020](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H92QK&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=PHY64E6Y43GHI55T)
* I use a [DBX286s](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWH79A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LWH79A&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=E3KFCLCQIXXLC7W4) to do all my audio compression and processing as I record and pipe it into my computer with a [Focusrite 2i2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OZE9SA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005OZE9SA&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=ELZASVHMTR6ZTNYL).

## Cameras and Lighting

* My webcam is a [Logitech HD Pro c920](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=webo080-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B006JH8T3S&linkId=65a64ee5dd16f2fa18faf2f2d33d0538)
* I run a [Sony RX100 III](https://amzn.to/36wUePu) with the HDMI out plugged into an [Elgato CamLink](https://amzn.to/3avQNts). I also have a cheaper [knockoff camlink](https://amzn.to/36B6rmj) that works pretty well.
* Above my desk I have a [Neewer 480 LED](https://amzn.to/3czWWHR) light that has seperate warm and cool light knobs. I bounce the light off the angled ceiling and it lights my face pretty well.
* I run [RGB Floodlights](https://amzn.to/3oGJPXG) for backfill lights. Still tweaking the colours of these to not look like a gamer.

### Desk Setup

* My main monitor is a 32" 4k [LG 32ud59](https://amzn.to/2SYuX8G). I usually run this at 1440 or 1692. Best developer monitor bang for your buck hands down.
* To my right I run a vertical 27" 4k [Dell 4k P2715Q](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PC9HFO8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PC9HFO8&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=5VCVP6ZUPF5GLCUJ) and an open loaded macbook pro nested on a [Rain mStand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=XWDACWNC2JWRF3DQ)
* I sit on a [polished aluminum Herman Miller aeron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LTAO8S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000LTAO8S&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=6G4M6ZR4CYKT3TM5)
* I swapped out the wheels for [ROLLER BLADE WHEELS](https://amzn.to/35zIwUF). Best upgrade ever, highly recommend these. If you have an ikea chair, get the 10mm ones, otherwise 11mm.
* My desk is an [8 foot oak butcher block countertop](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/karlby-countertop-oak-veneer-70335207/) on legs. Mine is solid oak, but it looks like they aren't currently selling a solid version. Most flooring and home improvement stores will sell butcher block.
* Here is a [photo of my setup](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1060643936140738560)
* Everything — Monitors, Ethernet, Hard Drives, Webcam, and Power — is plugged in via a single USB cable and piped into my [Caldigit TS3 Plus](https://amzn.to/2D9Jnx0) - This is a pretty sweet setup!
* All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an [Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub](http://amzn.to/2kVaDCz) to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable into the above dock.
* I currently use a 2019 16" MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 32gb memory
* My last laptop was a 2017 15" MacBook Pro 3.1GHz i7 with 16gb memory
* The keyboard is an Apple keyboard with a number pad. It's space grey so lots of people think it's some wicked hacker keyboard. I've tried a few mechanical keyboards but they are all too loud for my recording :)
* Mouse is a Logitech MX2 Master

### Other Gear

* After a lengthy search for the perfect backpack for both traveling and schlepping gear around the city I bought the [Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L](http://amzn.to/2kHB4kc) and it's incredible (and very expensive 😑).
* I listen to Bose QC35 headphones all day at my desk and AirPods Pro when on the go
