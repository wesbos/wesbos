Everyday I get a few emails asking about the specifics of some piece of software or hardware I use.

I change up things fairly often, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

If there is something missing leave a comment below or ask in my <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/ama">AMA</a> — happy to chat and help you figure out your own situation.

<h3>Editor + Terminal</h3>



    * <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is my current editor which I switched to in September 2017 after years of Sublime Text.

    * <a href="http://SublimeText.com/3dev">Sublime Text</a> V3 beta is used in most of my video tutorials — I write more about my setup in <a href="http://SublimeTextBook.com">my book</a>.

    * I created a theme called Cobalt2 for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2">VS Code</a>, <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm">iTerm2</a> v3 which I use.

    * I'm currently using <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/">Operator Mono</a> for a font. Yes I paid the $200 for it. Before that I used <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> for many years.

    * I use Operator Mono in VS Code and Hyper Term

    * I'm currently switching between Firefox Developer and Chrome Canary as my main browser

    * The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work - my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.

    * I currently use <a href="https://hyper.is/">Hyper</a> for my terminal, but many of my videos show me using iTerm2.

    * For Sublime Text, The JavaScript suggestions you see in my videos is called <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20Completions">JavaScript Completions</a> - you might have to play with the settings to get it to not popup some of the node completions. For VS Code, there are no plugins needed to get this.

    * You can see most of my config files (.eslint, VS Code settings) over at my <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles">Dot Files repo</a> but please don't just take these settings carte blanche - they work for me but might not be the best



<h3>Desktop Apps</h3>



    * I use <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander">Text Expander</a> for canned responses and for most of my code snippets

    * I'm a huge <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> fan and have many <a href="http://wes.io/fY7q">workflows</a>.

    * I use <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things App</a> with a <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD mindset</a> for managing my tasks.

    * I design almost entirely in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>

    * I backup with 2 time machines local HDDs, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> for most files, and <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/008x60">BackBlaze</a> for my entire hard drive.

    * The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is <a href="http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a>



<h3>Recording</h3>



    * I use <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">ScreenFlow</a> to record and edit my screencasts

    * I wrote about my <a href="http://wesbos.com/animated-gif-workflow/">animated gif workflow here</a>

    * My mic is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SOYOTQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SOYOTQ&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=YH6ZR6GSGBI2JOJF">Heil PR40</a> on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZVZ74/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SZVZ74&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=HJ6K3KRLOL5XJJSC">PL2T boom arm</a>. Many of my videos were recorded on the cheaper but still amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H92QK&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=PHY64E6Y43GHI55T">AT2020</a>

    * I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWH79A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LWH79A&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=E3KFCLCQIXXLC7W4">DBX286s</a> to do almost all my audio compression and processing as a I record and pipe it into my computer with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OZE9SA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005OZE9SA&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=ELZASVHMTR6ZTNYL">Focusrite 2i2</a>

    * My webcam is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=webo080-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B006JH8T3S&linkId=65a64ee5dd16f2fa18faf2f2d33d0538">Logitech HD Pro c920</a>

    * All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VDVCQ84/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00VDVCQ84&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=d8d1e7a3e461ab7921373dbc07dfbe38">Anker 7/3 port USB 3.0 hub</a> DIED 😵 <a href="http://amzn.to/2kVaDCz">Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub</a> to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable.

<h3>Other Gear</h3>



    * After a lengthy search for the perfect backpack for both traveling and schlepping gear around the city I bought the <a href="http://amzn.to/2kHB4kc">Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L</a> and it's incredible (and very expensive 😑).
