Hey everyone - a little trick here today with the HTML5 audio element and the Google translate API.

Turns out you can use <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate_tts?ie=UTF-8&q=hi%20this%20is%20wes&tl=en" target="_blank">this query string</a> to dynamically create an audio element. We can then encode our text, pop that url into an audio element and play it with a few lines of JavaScript.

It's worth noting that this isn't the real way to do text to speech, but its a very simple, cross browser solution that can help you out in a pinch.

Here is a quick video detailing how it works - I'd love to see what you all do with this.
