I'm often asked how I create the Animated Gifs that I post on <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/media">Twitter</a>.

I've done a lot of testing of different tools and I've settled on two things:



* <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">Cloudapp</a> for quick single shot gifs

* <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">Screenflow</a> for recording and editing + <a href="https://github.com/vvo/gifify">Node Gifify</a> for longer ones.



Here is a quick video detailing my workflow for top quality and fast GIFs.
