### This is a phrase I will no longer have to joke about when telling someone about my website. I've finally taken the time to create myself a brand spakin' new website. Its been almost 2.5 years since I launched the last one and a lot has changed. I'm very proud to launch this site as I think it reflects who I am a lot better than the old one.

\*\*I'm Blogging!\*\* Over the past couple of years I've gathered up so much knowledge, so many code snippets and many more insights on everything from web development to entrepreneurship. These were all great, but I never had a spot to put them! With the start of this blog, I hope to further establish myself by helping the community who I've learned so much from over the years.

### Ingredients

Incase you were wondering, the site, which is fairly simple in its make up, is run on WordPress with hints of HTML5, CSS3 and some jQuery.

### Suggestions

I am often asked questions by friends who are just getting into something like WordPress or jQuery. They are usually asking how I did something on a certain website, or how to get started with a certain lanaguage. If there is anything you want to ask me, please get in touch right now. I'm always looking for ideas to do tutorials and blog posts on, so I would love to hear from you!
