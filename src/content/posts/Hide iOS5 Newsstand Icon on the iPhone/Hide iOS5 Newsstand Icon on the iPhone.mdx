Many people, myself included, were annoyed that you aren't able to put the new Newsstand Icon in a folder. Well a quick little [hack](http://thecodingmassacre.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/newsstand-folder-no-jailbreak-ios-5/) I found today lets you do just that! Turns out you can trick iOS5 by creating a folder with other icons and then quickly drag it into that folder.

This doesn't require you to jail break, but it does take a quick finger! Watch this video to see how to do it:

### Note

This should only be done if you are no using newsstand. Trying to launch newsstand from within a folder crashes springboard!

Cool eh? Follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wesbos) for more like this :)
