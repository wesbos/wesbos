Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of everyone's /uses pages!

Everyday I get a few emails asking about the specifics of some piece of software or hardware I use.

I change up things fairly often, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

If there is something missing shoot me a tweet [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and I'll add it.

Most of these links are amazon affiliate links, so I'll get philthy rich if you click them and buy something.

### Editor + Terminal

* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is my current editor which I switched to in September 2017 after years of Sublime Text. I have a [list of extensions I use here](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles/blob/master/vs-code-extensions-i-use.md)
* I created a theme called Cobalt2 for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2">VS Code</a>, <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm">iTerm2</a> v3 which I use.
* I'm currently using <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/">Operator Mono</a> for a font. Yes I paid the $200 for it. Yes I actually like it. Before that I used <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> for many years.
* Firefox Developer has been my main browser since January 2020. We did a <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/213/hasty-treat-a-month-on-firefox">show on it here</a>

* The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work - my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.
* I currently use <a href="https://app.warp.dev/referral/2664Z2">Warp</a> for my terminal, but some of my videos show me using Hyper or iTerm2.

* You can see most of my config files over at my <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles">Dot Files repo</a> but please don't just take these settings carte blanche - they work for me but might not be the best.
* Both my eslint and prettier are wrapped into [eslint-config-wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos)
* In my tiktoks, you'll see the JavaScript result inlined beside my code. That is using [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/) Pro version. 


### Desktop Apps
* I use <a href="https://folivora.ai/">Better Touch Tool</a> for window management, custom keyboard shortcuts (via the Hyper key) and a few other things. Best mac software ever!
* I use <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander">Text Expander</a> for canned responses and for most of my code snippets
* I've always been a huge <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> fan and have many <a href="http://share.getcloudapp.com/fY7q">workflows</a> but have recently switched over to [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) which is even better!
* I use <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things App</a> with a <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD mindset</a> for managing my tasks.
* I design almost entirely in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>. One day I'll move to Figma.
* The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is <a href="http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a>


### Backup Strategy

My Backup strategy is as follows:

* I backup my entire computer locally to a Time Machine on a [LaCie rugged](https://amzn.to/3ti4IMp) portable hard drive
* I backup my entire computer remotely to <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/008x60">BackBlaze</a>
* I still use <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> quite a bit, but it's a huge resource hog.
* I run a <a href="https://amzn.to/3cvGMzf">Synology NAS DS920+</a> with 4 <a href="https://amzn.to/36S8lzh">4TB Seagate Ironwolf HDD</a> - I use this as storage for course videos that I'm not actively working on and then have those folders mirrored to Backblaze B2 as an off-site backup.

### Recording

* I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWH79A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LWH79A&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=E3KFCLCQIXXLC7W4">DBX286s</a> to do all my audio compression and processing as I record and pipe it into my computer with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3VG4jRs">Volt1</a> USB audio interface.

## Cameras and Lighting

* My webcam is a [Logitech HD Pro c920](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=webo080-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B006JH8T3S&linkId=65a64ee5dd16f2fa18faf2f2d33d0538)
* I run a [Sony RX100 III](https://amzn.to/36wUePu) with the HDMI out plugged into an [Elgato CamLink](https://amzn.to/3avQNts). I also have a cheaper [knockoff camlink](https://amzn.to/36B6rmj) that works pretty well.
* Above my desk I have a [Neewer 480 LED](https://amzn.to/3czWWHR) light that has seperate warm and cool light knobs. I bounce the light off the angled ceiling and it lights my face pretty well.
* I run [RGB Floodlights](https://amzn.to/3oGJPXG) for backfill lights. Still tweaking the colours of these to not look like a gamer.

### Desk Setup

* My main monitor is a 32" 4k [LG 32ud59](https://amzn.to/2SYuX8G). I usually run this at 1440 or 1692. Best developer monitor bang for your buck hands down.
* To my right I run a vertical 27" 4k [Dell 4k P2715Q](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PC9HFO8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PC9HFO8&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=5VCVP6ZUPF5GLCUJ) and an open loaded macbook pro nested on a [Rain mStand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=XWDACWNC2JWRF3DQ)
* I sit on a [polished aluminum Herman Miller aeron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LTAO8S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000LTAO8S&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=6G4M6ZR4CYKT3TM5)
* I swapped out the wheels for [ROLLER BLADE WHEELS](https://amzn.to/35zIwUF). Best upgrade ever, highly recommend these. If you have an ikea chair, get the 10mm ones, otherwise 11mm.

* My desk is an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/karlby-countertop-oak-veneer-70335207/">8 foot oak butcher block countertop</a> on legs. Mine is solid oak, but it looks like they aren't currently selling a solid version. Most flooring and home improvement stores will sell butcher block.
* Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1060643936140738560">photo of my setup</a>
* Everything â€” Monitors, Ethernet, Hard Drives, Webcam, and Power â€” is plugged in via a single USB cable and piped into my <a href="https://amzn.to/2D9Jnx0">Caldigit TS3 Plus</a> - This is a pretty sweet setup!
* All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an <a href="http://amzn.to/2kVaDCz">Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub</a> to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable into the above dock.

* I currently use a 2021 16" Macbook Pro M1 Max with 64 GB ram, 2TB drive
* Before that it was a 2019 16" MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 32gb memory

* The keyboard is an Apple keyboard with a number pad. It's space grey so lots of people think it's some wicked hacker keyboard. I've tried a few mechanical keyboards but they are all too loud for my recording :)
* Mouse is a Logitech MX2 Master

### Other Gear

* After a lengthy search for the perfect backpack for both traveling and schlepping gear around the city I bought the [Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L](http://amzn.to/2kHB4kc) and it's incredible (and very expensive ðŸ˜‘).
* I listen to Bose QC35 headphones all day at my desk and AirPods Pro when on the go
