Since I wrote <a href="https://SublimeTextBook.com">Sublime Text Power User</a> and recently released <a href="https://ReactForBeginners.com">React for Beginners</a> - one of the questions I get most often is how do I use Emmet shortcuts right inside of my JSX?

There are lots of tricks out there, but this is the proper way to get everything setup without any hacks.
