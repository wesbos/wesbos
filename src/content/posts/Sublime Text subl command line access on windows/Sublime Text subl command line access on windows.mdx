If you are a terminal or command line power user, you often want to open in from Sublime Text right from the cmd line. Often something like this:

`subl style.css`

On OSX and Linux, we have the subl command that comes with Sublime Text, to install it you can follow the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html" target="_blank">instructions here</a>.

However, on windows we need to do it a little different by creating something called a doskey.

So, if you wish to use the `subl` command to open files and folders from the command line in windows, you can use the following:

`doskey subl="C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2\sublime_text.exe" $*`

Paste the above into your command line prompt and this will make the `subl` command available to you.

If you are using Sublime Text 3, use the following instead:

`doskey subl="C:\Program Files\Sublime Text\sublime_text.exe" $*`
