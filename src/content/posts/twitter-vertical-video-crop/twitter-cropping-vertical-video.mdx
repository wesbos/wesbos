TLDR:

1. Use 1080x1920 for TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.
2. I've settled on quickly re-editing my 1080x1920 into 1920x1920 for Twitter and Linked-In. The square video embeds very nicely on both web and mobile feeds, and the extra room is great!
2. Use 1105 x 1920 on Twitter if you want "vertical" without cropping
4. Use 1440 x 1920 on Twitter for a bit more width
5. I made a video of [how I edit here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc06ZeO29R4)


I've been doing a bunch of vertical video lately for [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@wesbos), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos), [YouTube Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/c/WesBos/shorts), [Instagram Reels](https://instagram.com/wesbos), and even [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in.wesbos).

Vertical video is typically 1080 x 1920.

Inside of that, there is a "safe zone" - the area where its safe to put things like text that wont be cut off.

I've been keeping to 45px gutter on the left + right, which has worked so far.

Recently I received a few reports of my code being cut off on Twitter mobile apps - very frustrating.

To figure out which devices were cropping it, and how much I sent this tweet out:

100 Replies later, I've narrowed it down to this.

### Devices that Crop

It seems it's just iPhones, and the ones that do crop, all crop the same.

There were many instances where the same phone cropped and [didn't](https://twitter.com/invisiblea/status/1592266990424838144).

* ~98 px from the left and right.
* ~190px from the bottom
* 0px from the top

* iPhone XR
* iPhone XS Max
* iPhone 11
* iPhone 11 Pro Max
* iPhone 12 Mini
* iPhone 12
* iPhone 12 Pro
* iPhone 13 Pro
* iPhone 13 Mini

Almost every phone on this list had at least one instance of not cropping. So this is clearly an issue with Twitter.

There was only [one instance](https://twitter.com/vegasgeek/status/1592269450488983553) of it cropping the sides, but not the bottom.


### What to do? - 1105 x 1920

Since the video on Twitter doesn't _have_ to be 1080 x 1920, I thought about adding some width to the video, to see if that would stop it from cropping.

Adding height made it worse.

After a few tests, I found that adding 25px to each side tricked whatever aspect ratio twitter was looking for into showing the entire video.

I tried a bunch of sizes, and the lowest width I could find was 1105, where as 1100 was cropped.

## Final Thoughts

I tried uploading the same 1105x1920 to TikTok, and that seems to show the entire video as well, but then you lose the "full screen" feel.

So now I need to decide if I will export two copies of my video - one for Twitter, and one for everything else.
