<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights">Google Page Speed Insights</a> gives your site a score for speed an useablilty, and while I had a great score for useability, my score for speed was a pathetic **51/100**. My site is WordPress, and because of the plugin ecosystem inserts many blocking assets into your head, WordPress often gets flack for being slow.

So - armed with an hours worth of time, I set out to fix my own website while recording my progress. I'm far from a performance specialist, but hopefully this shows you that making your sites fast is a relatively simple task that can pay off huge for your users.

I mention a few WordPress/Apache specific things in this video, but the tips should apply to any site/server config.
