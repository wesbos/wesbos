Hey everyone - I'm super excited to announce that I've released my third big video series. It's called What The FlexBox?! - a simple, free 20 video series aimed at getting you to master CSS Flexbox.

I created this because while Flexbox is one of the best things to come to CSS layouts in years, it's a bit hard to initially learn. These 20 videos are short and focused on a single topic each - pick and choose which topics you need clarity on. The last 7 videos are all code-alongs where we will build some really great layouts with CSS Flexbox.

Grab them at <a href="http://Flexbox.io">Flexbox.io</a>. Enjoy and let me know what you think!
