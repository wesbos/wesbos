Today I'm excited to announce my latest project - <a href="http://CommandLinePowerUser.com">CommandLinePowerUser.com</a>. It's a free 11 video series for web developers on learning a modern command line workflow with ZSH, Z and related tools.

I created this video series after a successful launch of my <a href="https://SublimeTextBook.com">Sublime Text Book + Video Series</a>. The terminal is the perfect companion to Sublime Text, and as web developers I find we are spending more and more time in the command line with tools such as Git, Gulp, Grunt, Bower and so on. The command line is daunting at first, but hopefully with these videos you will find tips, tricks and a comfort in working in terminal.

Head on over to <a href="http://CommandLinePowerUser.com">CommandLinePowerUser.com</a> and grab the videos!
