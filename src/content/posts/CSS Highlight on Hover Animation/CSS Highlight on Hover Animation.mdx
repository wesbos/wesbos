<img src="highlight-hover.gif" alt="highlight-hover" width="633" height="344" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3702" />

I saw this great little highlight hover animation on Web Designer Depot the other day and I wondered how it worked. Turns out it's just a few lines of CSS along with some background-position and gradient tricks.

Check the video for a quick explanation on how it works. Enjoy!
