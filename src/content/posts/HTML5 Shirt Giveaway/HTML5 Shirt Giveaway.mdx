Happy New Year! I hope everyone had an awesome holidays. To celebrate, I'm going to be giving away 5 of these kickass HTML5 shirts that the folks at Microsoft have kindly provided.

These aren't your regular HTML5 shirts, they come from Canada so naturally they involve a polar bear, a beaver and a moose.
