When it comes time to migrate wordpress, it isn't all that easy. You have a number of things to move over including your database, your images, your themes and your plugins.

I've been teaching WordPress for years and by far the most common question I get is "How do I get my website online?"

Well, I've put everything I know into an in depth tutorial on how to migrate your site. This might take a little while the first time, but as you do it a few times, this becoming a pretty quick process.

I recommend using BlueHost for hosting WordPress as it is very affordable, the support is amazing, and they are professionals at hosting WordPress.
