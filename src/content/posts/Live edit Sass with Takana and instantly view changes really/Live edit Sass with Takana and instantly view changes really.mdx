A few days ago there was a buzz about a new Sublime Text package called <a href="http://usetakana.com/">Takana</a> which claimed to do live editing of Sass. As someone who works on fairly large Sass projects, I was skeptical but decided to give it a short.

Wow, it is fast.

Takana is built upon the blazing fast C/C++ libsass and works in parity with Sublime Text to listen to any changes in your code (not just a save).

This is huge for those who work with Sass and Sublime Text in their workflow. Here is a video exploring how to install and get up and running with some HTML, Sass and the Bourbon library.
