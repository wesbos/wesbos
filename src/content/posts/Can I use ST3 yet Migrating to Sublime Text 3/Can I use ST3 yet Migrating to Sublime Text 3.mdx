**So, can I move to Sublime Text 3 yet? **

I've had this question asked quite a few times over the past month so I thought I would write up a quick post on my answer: **probably.**

Since my last <a href="http://wesbos.com/sublime-text-3-first-look/" target="_blank">"First Look"</a> post on Sublime Text 3, 5 months have past and a lot has changed. Updates have been flying out, producing a faster and more stable Sublime Text 3.  Since then the beta has been opened to the public, so if you are still checking Sublime out, you can give ST3 a shot.



**Themes**

All themes, including my <a href="http://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2/">Cobalt2</a>, work flawlessly from ST2 to ST3. No worries here!

**Package Control, Plugins and Packages**

The reason we all didn't switch to ST3 the day it was released is because we had to wait for packages to be updated to Python 3.

In my experience, most of my packages have been migrated over, enough that I'm comftable using ST3 as my daily driver. If you are wondering about a certain fringe package, check the community wiki to see if it is supported in ST3. <a href="https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/wiki/Sublime-Text-3-Compatible-Packages">https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/wiki/Sublime-Text-3-Compatible-Packages</a>

Package control is the lifeline of all Sublime Text plugins and packages. Will Bond has been working hard to adapt package control to work both on ST2 and ST3. Installing Package control for ST3 is a little tricky, and migrating your old packages over can be a pain. I fiddled with it a few times and have come up with a quick method to do so.

I recommend you spend 9 mins watching the video but TLDR:

1) Use git to install the python3 branch of Package Control. Step by step instructions <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation#ST3" target="_blank">available here</a>.
2) Move over all your folders in **Sublime Text 2/Packages/ **to **Sublime Text 3/Packages/ **except two: `Default and Package Control`

Here is a quick video on the easiest way to do so:

**Terminal subl command**

If you are a heavy terminal user you will also need to switch over your terminal command to now open files in Sublime Text 3.

First delete the old one: `sudo rm  /bin/subl`

Then create the new one: `sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /bin/subl`

**Sublime Text Book**

I am still working on my Sublime Text Power User book and making excellent progress. I want to thank everyone who has emailed me asking about a launch date, I expect everything to be out in the next month or two. If you are interested, sign up below and I'll be sure to let you know when it launches!
