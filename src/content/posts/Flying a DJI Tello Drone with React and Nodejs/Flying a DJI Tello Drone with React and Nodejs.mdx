Hey Folks! Kind of a fun one here today. I wrote some JavaScript to fly a DJI Drone.

IBM is giving away 2,000 DJI Tello drones as part of a challenge and I made this video to help them promote it. This is the fun kind of stuff that originally got me excited about programming so I'd encourage you to try this out!
