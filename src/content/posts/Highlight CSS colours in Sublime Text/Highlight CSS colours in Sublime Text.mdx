In <a href="http://flexbox.io">What The Flexbox</a>, one of the biggest questions I've received is **"how do you get your colours to show up in Sublime Text like that"**?

I've answered it maybe 20 times now. The trick is getting them to show up all the time, instead of just when you click a color. This is one of my favourite packages because it works in CSS, Stylus, Sass and Less! Here is a quick 101. Watch the video or read the text below:

**First**, install the <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Color%20Highlighter">Color Highlighter package</a> from Package Control

**Next**, restart Sublime Text.

**Then**, in Preferences → Package Settings → Color Highlighter → Settings - User

Use the "filled" setting to make them show all the time.


```js
{
"ha_style": "filled"
}

```

**Enjoy! You can also grab my <a href="https://sublimetextbook.com/?utm_source=colorhighlighter&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=product">Sublime Text Book</a> and use WESBOS for $10 off.**
