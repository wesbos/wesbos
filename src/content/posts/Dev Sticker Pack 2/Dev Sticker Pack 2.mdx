Hey there - in an effort to promote a few of my projects, I got a whole bunch of stickers made! I've been handing them out like candy locally, but many have asked if I could mail you a few.

For $2, you will get a 5 sticker pack - that will help cover the cost of shipping and the PayPal Fees. Will ship anywhere in the world.

The stickers are:



* <a href="http://commandlinepoweruser.com">**Command Line Power User**</a> — my free video series on ZSH, Z + related tooling.

* <a href="https://sublimetextbook.com/">**Sublime Text Power User**</a> Badge - my book + video series on mastering Sublime Text

* ** Good At Gulp** - an upcoming book + video series I'm working on

* **Gulp Logo** - only 100 of these left!

* **What The FlexBox** - an upcoming video series on FlexBox



Interested? I have enough stickers for about 150 packs. Fill out the form below and I'll throw them in the mail for you. By signing up, I'll send you an email when I launch new video or book tutorials.

**Sorry Folks - I've given them all away. Make sure to follow me on twitter or like my FB page - I'll give away some more once I've got them printed! **
