Toggling comments in Sublime Text is broken and it's time you fix it. If you work with HTML/JavaScript you have probably run into this while using the ⌘ + / comment toggle.

Sublime Text thinks it is JavaScript, so it uses a JavaScript comment! The problem is that the script tag is acutally HTML, so we need to use an HTML comment to comment it out. We want something like this:

`<!-- <script src="jquery.js"></script> -->`

The underlying problem is inside the HTML syntax file and it is actually an easy fix.

We need to edit the `HTML.tmLanguage file that is located in preferences →  browse packages → HTML`.

Open it up and look for a line that looks like the following. It should be around line 286.

`<string>(?:^\s+)?(<)((?i:script))\b(?![^>]*/>)</string>`

Replace it with this:

`<string>(?:^\s+)?(<)((?i:script))\b(?![^>]*/>)(?!.*</script>)</string>`

Save. You should now be able to properly toggle comment out script tags in Sublime Text!
