This is a little known secret of Sublime Text - the ability to have multiple items in your clipboard history and access them with the keyboard.

To access the clipboard history, simply hit `⌘ + K, ⌘ + V - so just add the ⌘ + K infront of your regular paste shortcut. Windows users swap out ⌘ with Ctrl`.
