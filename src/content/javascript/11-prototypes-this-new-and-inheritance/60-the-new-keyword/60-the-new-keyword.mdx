This lesson is on classes, prototypes, and the keywords `this` and `new`.

We are grouping these things together because they are all connected and are the foundations for what is often called **object-oriented programming** and another popular paradigm **functional programming**.

Let's get started with the `new` keyword and understanding how it works.

Create a new file `new-this.html` in the playground directory.

Inside the file we want to add our HTML base, and change the title to "New, This, Prototypes and Classes".

Add a script tag within the body tag with a log - "it works" and open the HTML page to ensure it is working.

So what is the **`new`** keyword?

We have already used it a couple of times like when we throw an error, create a date or create a new array using the new keyword.

Speaking of dates, let's say you had a date that you assigned the value of August 11 2025 to and logged it to the console, it would return a string representation of the date.

```js
const myDate = new Date('August 11, 2025');
console.log(myDate);
```

If we did `console.dir(myDate);` instead, you will see that we have our date and inside of it we have a prototype of tons of different methods.

Let's say you were to log `myDate.getFullYear()`, you will see we get 2025 in the console.

![log of myDate.getFullYear() in console](./905.webp)

Where did the `getFullYear()` method come from?

The same thing when we create an array, we automatically have all these new methods like `pop`, `push`, `slice` and `splice`. Where do those all come from?

That is because when you create a date, an object, an array, a string, a number or any of those things, we are essentially creating a new object in JavaScript that is extended off the constructor, or as Wes likes to refer to it as, the momma object.

If we take a look at all of the types that we have by entering them into the console, such as `Array`, `Object`, `Date`, `Number` you will see that they are all just functions, which if run with the new keyword in front of it, will return a new object.

![log of functions run with the new keyword](./906.webp)

That is why we say in JavaScript everything is an object. Even though a number is just a number, when we create a new number, we have all these methods that exist on it. So although the number is just a number, it is packed with all these methods for working with it.

Let's go back to the date example.

Because we are creating a new `Date`, we have this variable `myDate` which is an instance of `date`. If you were to type into a console `typeof myDate`, it would return an object. But if you were to type `myDate instanceof Date` it would return true.

![typeof and instanceof operator with date](./908.webp)

`myDate` is an object, but it is an instance of our special object that we have in the browser that is called a `date`.

The same thing happens with arrays.

In the script tag, add `const name = ['wes', 'kait'];`.

If you try running `typeof` and `instanceof Array` in the console, you should see the same result -- names is an instance of an array but an object itself.

![typeof and instanceof operator with arrays](./909.webp)

With the array, it might be a bit confusing because you don't see the `new` keyword being used. Same thing when you create an object like `const wes = { name: 'wes' };`.

Why are we able to use the instance if we aren't using the `new` keyword?

Because that way of making arrays and objects is referred to as **literal syntax**. They are the same thing as doing

```js
const names = new Array('wes', 'kait');
const wes = new Object({ name: 'wes' });
```

![log of names holding array and wes holding object, created using new keyword](./910.webp)

As you can see, the array and object look the same. The only difference is it is a shorter syntax.

Some other things like dates don't have a literal syntax, which is why we have to put the `new` keyword infront of it.

It's the same thing when you create an element.

```js
const span = document.createElement('span');
console.log(span);
```

If you tried to check whether `span` was an instance of an element you could do `span instanceof Element` which should return true because `Element` was the base one and `span` is the instance that we created.

![log of span instanceof Element, returning true](./911.webp)

Why didn't we use `new Element`?

We can take a look at the span constructor by doing `span.constructor` in the console.
What that will do is it gives us a single `HTML` span element.

Let's check if these are true by entering the following into the console.

```js
span instanceof HTMLSpanElement;
span instanceof Node;
```

Both will return true. Why? Is it an element, is it a span, is it a node?

We will learn more about this in later classes but essentially things can start very basic like a node with text. Then it can go a little further and become an element, and have a tag and attributes. And then it can go even further and become a special kind of element like an image or div. In all of those cases, the element inherits the Node and the `HTMLSpanElement` inherits the `Element`.

![log of span as instanceof HTMLSpanElement and Node](./912.webp)

That is what is referred to as **extending** which we will get into when we discuss classes.

So when using `document.createElement()` we do not need a `new` keyword because it does that under the hood.

Let's build our own to get a better grasp on this. We will make a pizza.

```js
function Pizza() {
  console.log('Making a pizza');
}
```

What we have done is added the ability to make a new pizza.

Let's create one and try it first without the `new` keyword.

```js
const pepperoniPizza = Pizza();
console.log(pepperoniPizza);
```

If you refresh the page, you will see we get `undefined`.

![undefined log in console](./914.webp)

That makes sense because the function did not return anything.

```js
const pepperoniPizza = new Pizza();
```

Add the new keyword as shown above, and when you check the logs you will see that we get a pizza object with nothing because we haven't added anything to it yet.

![console of pizza object with its constructor](./915.webp)

What happens is when you use the `new` keyword on a function, it creates a new instance object of that function instead of whatever has been returned from that function.

To reiterate, by using the `new` keyword in JavaScript, it creates a new object that is an instance of whatever function you have made it from. That makes a lot more sense when we get into the `this` keyword, `constructors` and `classes`.

We could take this a bit further and look at the `constructor` by logging it.

```js
console.log(pepperoniPizza.constructor);
```

The constructor will tell us what function made it.

![log of the object constructor](./916.webp)

Same thing with our span. If we look at our constructor, we see that the thing that made the span was the `HTMLSpanElement` function.

If you were to type `pepperoniPizza instanceof Pizza` we would see true returned in the console.
