Hot tip for anyone doing AI dev:

Use Ollama to easily run models like Deepseek-r1 or Gemma locally on your machine.  It downloads them and spins up a server with an OpenAI SDK compatible API

The smaller models are fast and good enough to work on new features or debug streaming without having to pay for API requests
