# Contact

Hey! I get lots of email, so please scan this page before firing one off. Don't be afraid to email me, it just might take a few days (or weeks) for me to get back to you 😃.

**If you want me to work for you**, I am not accepting any client work at the moment, but I'd recommend you [hire a Juno College freelancer](https://junocollege.com/alumni/available-for-hire) - they are great!

**If you need help with a course**, please jump into the [Slack channel](https://wesbos.slack.com) and have myself or someone from the support help you.

**If you want to know what font, theme, computer or toilet paper I use**, all that info is available on my [/uses](/uses) page.

**If you are a recruiter**, I love you, but please don't call or email me 🙂. I'm also not able to help you find someone for your position.

**If you need a receipt for a course**, you can get that on your [courses.wesbos.com](https://courses.wesbos.com) dashboard.

**If you want career or development advice**, I'm happy to help as best I can. I prefer you submit it as a potluck question on [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) so the greater community can benefit, but I'll still try answer if you want to privately!

**I will absolutely take your free stuff**. If you want to send me a sticker, tshirt (large), hot sauce or honda civic. I can't promise I'll share or talk about your thing, but if it's cool I likely will! Contact me for my PO Box address.

**You did it!** For everything else including **course suggestions**, **conference invites**, **private training**, **podcast sponsorship** and **BBQ tips**, please email [hey@wesbos.com](mailto:hey@wesbos.com)

Here are a few tips on writing me:

* Use paragraphs, avoid large walls of text.
* Number your asks if there are multiple
* Keep it as short as you can
* Post code on a git repo, [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or smaller stuff or errors in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Screenshots are helpful too!

Thanks, have a great day!
