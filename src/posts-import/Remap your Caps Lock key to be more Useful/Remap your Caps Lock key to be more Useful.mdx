I'm a big keyboard shortcut user. After a while you may find that you are running out of easy keyboard shortcuts.

One little trick that many developers do is to remap their capslock key to something a little more useful.

In my case, I remapped my capslock key to open up the Divvy window manager.

Whatever you use it for is up to you, but don't just let a perfectly good key sit dormant! Watch the 5 min video below or follow the instructions. Happy keyboarding!

<h3>Disable the Capslock key</h3>

First thing you'll need to do is open <code>System Preferences</code> → <code>Keyboard</code> → Then click the <code>Modifier Keys</code> button in the lower right.

Set your capslock key to <strong>No Action</strong> and repeat for every keyboard you have attached in the "Select Keyboard" dropdown. If you are on a laptop with an external keyboard you'll need to do this twice.

<h3>Remap the Key</h3>

Now that Caps Lock is disabled, we need to remap it to another key. When you press a key, the OS sends a KeyCode to the program letting them know what key was pressed. I made a little site to help you with this in JavaScript: <a href="http://keycode.info">http://keycode.info</a>.

To do this, we need to use a program called <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en" target="_blank">Seil</a> (previously PCKeyboardHack). Download, install and open it.

Check the first box that says <strong>"Change Caps Lock"</strong> and set the keycode to be one that you do not use and ideally a key that you do not have. A popular choice here is 80, which maps to F19. Unless you have a huge keyboard, you probably do not have an F19 key.

Now when you press your Caps Lock key, they system will interpret this as a press of the F19!

Now you get to choose which program you want to map Caps Lock to. I chose Divvy:

It works with any program that accepts a hot key including Alfred and Slate.
