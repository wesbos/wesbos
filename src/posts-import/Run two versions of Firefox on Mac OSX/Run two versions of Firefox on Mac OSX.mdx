Yesterday Firefox 4.0 was released and web developers everywhere celebrated a really great browser.  The browser comes packed with a super fast JavaScript engine called JägerMonkey. Now don't get too excited just yet! We still need to keep that old version of Firefox around for testing; we can't assume everyone has upgraded to Firefox 4. So, to run both Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 4.0 on the same machine, just follow these simple steps:<!--more-->
<ol>
	<li>Open up your Applications folder and find your old version of Firefox</li>
	<li>Right click-> get info.</li>
	<li>Rename to "Firefox36.app"</li>
	<li>Download Firefox 4.0 and install as normal</li>
	<li>Celebrate that you now have 1 more browser to test in!</li>
</ol>
Really simple! If someone knows how to do this on the Windows and Linux side, I would love to hear how.
