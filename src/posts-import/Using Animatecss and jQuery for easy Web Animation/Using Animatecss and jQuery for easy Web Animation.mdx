<a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">Animate.css </a> is a fantastic little library of Animations that takes the messy keyframing out of web animations. While they can definitely be abused, short and subtle animations are a great way of adding feedback and interaction to your website or web app.

While you can get away with just using the CSS classes, you will most likely want to apply these animations on command with JavaScript. This short tutorial will show you how to get setup with animate.css, use it properly with jQuery and listen for the <code>animationend</code> event to take the classes off.

Hope you enjoy, please leave any questions or comments below!
