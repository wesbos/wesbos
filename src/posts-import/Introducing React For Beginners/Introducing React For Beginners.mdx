I'm super excited to announce <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React For Beginners</a> - my new premium step-by-step training course to get you building real world React.js + Firebase apps and website components. You probably can't stop hearing about React as of late and that is because it makes building interactive interfaces both really fun and easy.

This is my second premium product after my <a href="https://SublimeTextBook.com">Sublime Text Book</a> and many who have taken the free <a href="http://Flexbox.io">Flexbox.io</a> and <a href="http://CommandLinePowerUser.com">CommandLinePowerUser.com</a> courses are now learning react.

This course has only been out for 3 weeks and over 2,300 other devs have already joined me in learning React.js! If you are interested in leveling up your JavaScript skills and learning React, head on over to <a href="https://ReactForBeginners.com">ReactForBeginners.com</a> and take at what it all covers.

Enjoy!
