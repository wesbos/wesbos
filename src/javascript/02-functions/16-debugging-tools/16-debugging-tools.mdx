There are 2 parts of debugging:

1. there are tools you can use to get info when things go wrong
2. the right mindset to be a good problem solver

This video will focus on the tools.

As you go through the course, anytime we start to hit a roadblock, Wes won't cut it out of the video, he will leave it in and show us his thought process.

We will be working out of the `16 - Debugging` folder which is in the `exercises` directory. Within that folder, there should be two files: `debugging-START.js` and `debugging.html`.

If you open `debugging.html`, you will see that it's just a basic html file where we are loading our base CSS, we have a button that says make me bigger and then a script tag that is loading `debugging.js` which doesn't exist yet.

Make a copy of the `debugging-START.js` file and save it as `debugging.js`.

This file contains a bunch of stuff we haven't learned yet:

- arrays of objects,
- loops,
- functions
- event listeners
- etc.

It doesn't matter that we don't know what all those different things do yet, Wes will explain them later and we will learn how to build our own. This is more so we can test different types of debugging.

## Console Debugging

We will start with console debugging.

There is `console.log()` which is the most common one you'll see. 👇

```js
people.forEach((person, index) => {
  console.log(person.name);
});
```

There is `console.info(person.name)` which usually gives you a little eye and circle beside the console output but it doesn't seem to be there right now.

There is `console.error(person.name)`.

That isn't used for throwing or handling errors (we will learn about that), this just changes what the log looks like in the console, as shown below 👇

![console error method does not throw any error but it changes the log appearence as an error](/console-error-in-console.png)

It also gives you a stack trace 👇

![console error method also gives stack trace](/error-stack-trace-in-console.png)

There is `console.warn()` which is very similar to `console.log()` 👇

![console warn method is similar to console log](/console-warn-in-console.png)

There is `console.table()`.

Anytime you have a list of objects, and the objects have the same property (meaning the objects all have `name`,`cool`, and `country` properties), `console.table()` will format that into a nice little table.

```js
console.table(people);
```

![console table method prints an object as a pretty table for better visibility](/console-table-in-console.png)

There is `console.count()`.

This is useful if you want to know how many times a function is being run.

If we go into the `doctorize()` function in `debugging.js` and add `console.count('running doctorize');`, and then refresh the html page, every time you type `doctorize('wes');` in the console, the console will log a count.

![console.count helps to determine how many times a function is being run](/console-count-in-console.png)

That is useful in a scenario where you aren't sure if a function is running twice, or sometimes you are working with hover elements and it's getting triggered way too often. `console.count()` will show you how many times it's actually running.

You can also pass variables to `console.count()`. To demonstrate that, let's change the example to use backticks, like so 👇

```js
function doctorize(name) {
  console.count(`running Doctorize for ${name}`);
  return `Dr. ${name}`;
}
```

Now if you type in the console `doctorize('wes')`, it will show the count, but if you run `doctorize('snickers');`, it goes back to one.

![console count increments the function call count for similar arguments](/console-count-with-function-arguments.png)

But if you call `doctorize('wes');` again, it maintains that count.

![when doctorize function with same argument named wes called again, it will increment the count](/console-count-for-different-arguments-in-console.png)

`console.count()` is based on what strings you pass it.

Next we have `console.group()`, that can be helpful if you have a bunch of stuff to log.

We will make a function `doALotOfStuff` to demonstrate this.

Comment out all of the example consoles we have gone over so far.

```js
console.group("Doing some stuff");
```

👆 Add the code above, and then underneath it, add a few more consoles such as log, warning, error. Then add `console.groupEnd()` and pass it the same string we had passed to `console.group()`, like so 👇

```js
function doALotOfStuff() {
  console.group("Doing some stuff");
  console.log("Im one");
  console.warn("watch out!");
  console.error("hey");
  console.groupEnd("Doing some stuff");
}
```

![console group will put all the consoles together as single block and ends where console groupEnd is called](/console-group-in-console.png)

What that does is it groups together all of the logs into a group-able thing, and that can be very helpful.

We will do another example in the `people.forEach()` method.

```js
people.forEach((person, index) => {
  console.group(`${person.name}`);
  console.log(person.country);
  console.log(person.cool);
  console.log("DONE!!");
  console.groupEnd(`${person.name}`);
});
```

![using console group with forEach method to keep a person details together as a group](/console-group-practical-example-in-console.png)

As you can see, it nicely organizes the people into their separate collapsible section. 👆

```js
console.groupCollapsed();
```

You can actually also use the `.groupCollapsed()` method shown above 👆 which will by default collapse all the groups, as shown below 👇.

![use console groupCollapsed to collapse all the groups by default](/console-group-collapse-in-console.png)

Those are the main console methods that Wes uses to debug something.

Comment out all the `console.group()` code.

## The Call Stack and Stack Trace

Next we will talk about something called the **call stack** or the **stack trace**. _The stack trace will tell you which function called what function called what function._

If you scroll down to the function `go`, you will see that it calls `doctorize`, which will first call `greet`.

There is a lot going on in the code.

![stack trace gives us a sequence of functions that were called, helping in the debugging](/multiple-functions-definition.png)

You will notice that inside of `greet()` we have this function that doesn't exist, and that will cause an error. If we try to run that from the console, you will see an uncaught reference error.

If you expand the error, you should see a few messages below, which are often ignored by new developers but are actually very useful in debugging.

If you want to know what went wrong, you have to get good at reading the call stacks. It's pretty simple!

![doesnt function not defined error](/does-not-exist-not-defined-error-in-console.png)

In the error log above, the console is letting us know that the error happened at the `greet()` function, which is on line 47 of `debugging.js`. This is where the actual error happened.

That is good, but errors aren't always that easy.

You might need to know where the `greet()` function was called from.

To figure that out, you would go to the next line which tells you that it was called by `go()` on line 52.

And then it says `at <anonymous>:1:1`. What does that mean?

We are getting that message because we called the function from the console.

That would look different if we actually made another function that called go instead like so 👇

```js
function bootstrap() {
  console.log('starting the app!');
  go();
}
```

If you call `bootstrap()` from the console, you will see 👇

![calling bootstrap function from console](/calling-bootstrap-function-in-console.png)

If you were to modify `debugging.js` to add a call to bootstrap on page load like so: `bootstrap();`, you won't see that anonymous function line in the call stack.

![calling bootstrap function on page load wont display anonymous function line in call stack](/calling-bootstrap-function-on-page-load.png)

Go ahead and comment out the `bootstrap()` call now.

## Grabbing Elements

Next we will learn about the grabbing of elements.

This is a handy tip that Wes uses often. If you're on a website, and you're inspecting it, and focusing on an element such as this input from Mozilla's website by clicking on it in the element inspector, if you flip over to the console and type `$0`, it will return to you whatever element you had currently selected in the elements tab.

![select the html element clicking on inspect in browser](/selecting-the-element-in-inspect-mode.png)

![grabbing elements in console using $0 where we are focusing the element through click](/grabbing-elements-in-console.png)


That is very useful because now you could do something like call `$0.value()` against it, and it will tell you what you have typed inside the input.

![to view the value of grabbed element type $0.value()](/view-value-inside-element-in-console.png)

You might be wondering, what does `0` in the `$0` mean.

It means the last element that was clicked.

If you were to go back to the elements tab, select another element like a button, when you go back to the console `$0` will give you the button element and`$1` will give you the input.

![browser will keep track of the sequence of grabbing elements](/sequence-of-selecting-elements-in-console.png)

You can keep going forever, if you click another element, it will remember the order in which they were clicked.

Another cool thing you can do is to use the `$` and `$$` symbol in the console.
You cannot use these things in your code, it only works in the console. Also, if jQuery is loaded on the page, that won't work.

![use $ and $$ symbols if jQuery is not loaded on the page](/symbols-$-and-$$-in-console.png)

👆 Those are shorthand selectors for two things we will learn about in a future video about the DOM. Those selectors will allow us to select things based on selectors.

`$('p')` will give us `document.querySelector()`, which will match the first thing that matches the selector passed.

`$$('p')` will match ALL of the elements that match the selectors.

![$ shorthand to use document querySelector and $$ shorthand to use document querySelectorAll](/use-of-$-and-$$-symbols-in-console.png)

In the value returned from `$('p')` you can see it found the first paragraph, and with `$$('p')`, it found all of the `p` elements on the page.

## Breakpoints

Next we will talk about breakpoints.

```js
console.log(person.name);
```

Go into the `people.forEach()` method and delete all the logs that we had commented out within it and add the code above 👆

If you refresh the html page, you will see everyone's name logged to the console.

What you can do is, within the `people.forEach()` method, if you want to pause JavaScript from running, you can type `debugger;`, like so 👇

```js
people.forEach((person, index) => {
  debugger;
  console.log(person.name);
});
```

That is a statement that only takes into effect when your dev tools are open, and it will pause JavaScript from running and allow us to peer into JavaScript at that very moment.

If you refresh `debugging.html` now, what happens is that we have set what is called a **breakpoint**. When you set a breakpoint, you are telling JavaScript to break execution of code when it reaches that line.

![debugger in source tab to debug the code](/debugger-in-source-tab.png)

This gives you a whole bunch of information as to what happened.

If you hover over it, it will show you what the variables are equal to at this point in time.

![variable shows the values they are having on this point of time](/variable-holding-values-runtime.png)

You can see that the JavaScript has paused and if you go to the console, you will see that nothing has been logged yet.

Flip back to the sources tab.

On the right hand-side of the `Sources` tab, that is where all the different tools for inspecting what is going on reside.

![different tools for inspecting more during debugging](/tools-for-inspection-during-debugging.png)

We get the call stack, which we learned about earlier.

It will also let us know what the local variables are.

You can expand the collapsed Local section within the Scope section, or hover over a variable to see it's value.

![expand the collapsed local option inside scope section, or hover a variable to see their value](/see-variables-value.png)

There are other sections for breakpoints which we will get to in a second.

![press play button to execute next statement in the sequence](/resume-script-execution.png)

What is cool is you can click the play button shown above , and then if you flip back to the console, you will see that the name "Wes" has been logged.

What happened there is when the function first ran, it hit the breakpoint and then when we pressed play, it logged the first persons name and then because it's in a loop, it hit the breakpoint again and paused.

Now you can see that the second person is equal to Scott.

![second person equals to scott](/second-person-is-equal-to-scott.png)

You can also step over into the next function call like so 👇

![use redo button to step over to next function call](/step-over-to-next-function-call.png)

When you hit play, it will just continue execution of the code until it hits the next breakpoint.

If you click the option beside the play button that says "Step over next function call", it allows you to run the code line by line.

![the next play button beside step over next function call allows to run code line by line](/breakpoint.gif)

When you feel like you are logging too much data in order to see it, or you are logging something quickly so you can see what happened in the past, adding a debugger (it can go anywhere in your JavaScript code) can be very helpful.

It's a handy way to slow things down and peer into what the different pieces of data are.

You can also set breakpoints from the browser as well.

Remove the line of code in `debugger.js` that says `debugger;` and refresh `debugging.html` in the browser.

Open the sources tab.

![source tab](/source-tab.png)

In the sidebar on the left, you can click on your actual JavaScript files that are loaded on the page, and then you can say something like "when someone runs this go() function, I want to put a breakpoint in there"

![put a breakpoint by clicking on the left side of line](/put-a-breakpoint-in-source-tab.png)

What you do is you click the line number next to the line of code that you would like to pause during.

If you go into the console and type `go()`, you will see that the code pauses itself in the debugger at the line where you set the breakpoint.

_Recap: you can either create the breakpoint by clicking next to the line number in the sources tab, or adding the word `debugger;` anywhere in your JavaScript._

Always make sure you remove those `debugger;` calls from your code once you are finished!

We talked about scope earlier. Scope will allow us to peer into what variables are, we will look at that more in the next video.

## Network Request

The next one is Network Request.

This is useful if you want to see what is being fired off when you load the page. If you go to your networks tab and refresh `debugging.html`, you will see all of the different files that are needed in order for the page to work.

![to view the files loaded in website to make it work can be tracked via network tab](/files-loaded-in-website-in-network-tab.png)

This is helpful because you can see when the data is being sent to you.

Wes added a function to `debugging.js` called `fetchDadJoke()`.

What that function will do is go off to an API and grab a random dad joke.

Don't worry about what all the lines of code mean here, we will go over that in future videos. For now, just know that it goes to an external API and grabs a joke.

```js
// A Dad joke fetch
async function fetchDadJoke() {
  const res = await fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", {
    headers: {
      Accept: "text/plain",
    },
  });
  const joke = await res.text();
  console.log(joke);
  return joke;
}
```

If you were to run the `fetchDadJoke()` function in the console, it will return a dad joke and log it to the console.

If you go back to the network tab, you will see that there is a new item that has been logged.

![track http requests and response to endpoints using network tab](/http-requests-in-network-tab.png)

This tells you the information about the request, what actually happened, the raw response and a preview of it. It gives you information such as how long did this request take.

![timing in network tab tells the information regarding request, response and how much time it took to respond back](/timing-in-network-tab.png)

For example, if your website is slow, it will tell you how long the request took, and where the time was spent.

To demonstrate this, go to http://apple.com and inspect the network tab.

You will see that there are 100s of things that are requested. You can also filter out the requests within the network tab such as XHR, which is when they're sending data out about you.

![filter the network requests by types](/filtering-network-requests-by-types.png)

## Break On Attribute

Next we will go over break on attribute. Wes doesn't use this one often, but it can be useful.

On `debugging.html` there is a button that says "Make me bigger".

![make me bigger button](/make-me-bigger-button.png)

When you click it, it gets bigger.

If you go to your elements, you will see that the font-size is just being bumped up every time the button is pressed.

If you don't know where the JavaScript is that is making that button bigger, you can go into you button in the elements tab of dev tools and select _Break on > Attribute Modifications_.

![to see what is causing this button to change the size, use break on and then attribute modification](/break-on-attribute-modification.png)

This is just another way of adding a breakpoint.

There is also something called **subtree modifications** which is what it is referred to when somebody adds a div for example.

There is also something called **node removal** which is when someone removes an element or text from something.

We will just focus on attribute modifications.

Set the breakpoint on attribute modification and now when we click the button, the breakpoint should be triggered and bring us to the sources tab which will show you where that attribute is being modified from.

![by setting the breakpoint on attribute modification we can make use of source tab to find where attribute is being modified from](/attribute-breakpoint.gif)

That is very useful when you get thrown into a random code base where you don't really know what is going on.

Finally, if you go to the sources tab again, you will see that there are other things on the right hand side.

![other features in source tab includes dom breakpoints, global listeners, event listener breakpoints](/other-features-in-source-tab.png)

You can throw Event Listener breakpoints, such as mouse click. 👇

![add event listener breakpoint](/event-listener-breakpoint.png)

If you add that breakpoint, now when you click on the button, it will throw a debugger breakpoint for you.

There are also XHR breakpoints:

![xhr and fetch breakpoints allows to break the code whenever a fetch request is made](/xhr-fetch-breakpoints.png)

If you click `Any XHR or fetch`, what that will do is anytime a fetch request is made, anytime someone goes off to an external API, the code will break execution.

To test this you can set the breakpoint option and then go into the console and try typing `fetchDadJoke()`.

You will see that it pauses in the debugger where the fetch request is made and we can actually step through it.

Wes would estimate that around 98% of the debugging that he does is done using console.log, breakpoints and network requests.

He will turn to the other types of debugging tools available typically in severe edge cases where he is stumped.
