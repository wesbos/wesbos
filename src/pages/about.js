      <H>About</H>
      <p>Hey, I'm Wes Bos.</p>
      <Img image={data.wes} alt="Wes Bos sits at a table in the direct sunlight pretending to be on his computer" />

      <H as="h3">The Skinny&hellip;</H>
      <p suppressHydrationWarning={true}>
        I'm a web developer, teacher and speaker from Hamilton, Ontario ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I'm <span title={`That's ${age} ms!`}>{ageAsYears}</span> years old and I've been{' '}

        </a>{' '}
        for about {timeAsYears} years - or <em>exactly</em> <TimeSinceStarting /> milliseconds!
      </p>

      <p>I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. Though constantly changing, my focus right now is React.js, Node/Deno, Express, Serverless, Gatsby and Next.js.</p>
      <p>
        I create <Link to="/courses">online courses</Link> and run a <a href="https://syntax.fm">web development podcast</a> called Syntax.
      </p>

      <H as="h3">A little more&hellip;</H>
      <p>
        <strong>I've been in love with web development</strong> for over half my life. Seems weird, right? It's a space of constant improvement and new &amp; exciting technology. I consider myself a hacker in that I'm always using technology to solve my life's problems and ambitions.

      <p>
        <strong>I love to teach.</strong> I got my start teaching with{' '}

          Ladies Learning Code
        </a>{' '}

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I live</strong> in a really cool city called Hamilton with my <a href="http://kaitbos.com/">wife Kaitlin</a>, two girls, two boys and a pup named Snickers. We spend our summers at our cottage up in beautiful Northern Ontario.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I have a few hobbies. </strong>I've rebuilt hundreds of vintage road racing bikes. I fancy myself as a good cook, enjoyer of cast iron, smoking meat on my Big Green Egg and have been known to make some pretty killer pulled pork. I love tools and I'll try fix anything - appliances, electronics, kids toys and things around the house.

      <H as="h3">Bio</H>

      <p>You can stop reading here. This is just a succinct bio that podcast hosts and conference organizers can use to introduce me when they have me on. Otherwise they find a super old one!</p>
