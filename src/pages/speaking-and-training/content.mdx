# Speaking and Training

I'm still working on this page, but if you'd like to have me come speak at your conference or do a private workshop at your work, please get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:hey@wesbos.com">hey@wesbos.com</a>.

I usually like to speak about JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Hot Tips, React.js, Node.js and related topics.

Soon this page will have links to past + upcoming speaking and training events.
