        <strong>I've been in love with web development</strong> for over half my life. Seems weird, right? It's a space
        of constant improvement and new &amp; exciting technology. I consider myself a hacker in that I'm always using
        technology to solve my life's problems and ambitions.

        <strong>I have a few hobbies. </strong>I've rebuilt hundreds of vintage road racing bikes. I fancy myself as a
        good cook, enjoyer of cast iron, smoking meat on my Big Green Egg and have been known to make some pretty killer
        pulled pork. I love tools and I'll try fix anything - appliances, electronics, kids toys and things around the
        house.

        You can stop reading here. This is just a succinct bio that podcast hosts and conference organizers can use to
        introduce me when they have me on. Otherwise they find a super old one!
